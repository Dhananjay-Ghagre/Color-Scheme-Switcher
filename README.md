# Color-Scheme-Switcher

This simple HTML document features a Color Scheme Switcher that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on different color buttons. The associated CSS file (style.css) is responsible for styling, and the functionality is implemented using JavaScript (change.js).

How to Use

1.Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser.
2.You will see a set of color buttons (grey, white, blue, yellow) under the heading "Color Scheme Switcher."
3.Click on one of the color buttons to change the background color of the page.
4.Experiment with different color options and observe the background color change.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript file (change.js) listens for click events on the color buttons.
When a button is clicked, it checks the id of the button and sets the background color of the <body> accordingly.
